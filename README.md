# Why POTUS?

Hello political lovers
Since we are nearing the election period president.finance decided to bring you the new POTUS!
In this DeFi craze while developers are trying to sell you their badly done fast food, we want to give the community the chance to directly elect the face of their POTUS.

There will be multiple phases for president.finance
1st the Pre-election phase where there will be multiple pools where users will be able to get their POTUS tokens.
After the Pre-election, the 2nd phase kicks in when users will vote for the Potus!
The election will determine the Potus who will be the face of the upcoming Clearing House, a UniSwap/Sushi fork that aims to get Crypto from food stands into the political circles.

Don't wait and grab the chance to have a vote in the election of the Potus!
POTUS tokens will also entitle you to continue to earn a portion of the Clearing House protocol's fee, accumulated in POTUS, even if you decide to no longer participate in the liquidity provision.

As an early adopter to help provide liquidity, you become a significant stakeholder of the clearing house protocol.
The earnings that you'll receive from staking will be proportional to the amount of LP tokens you have staked versus the total amount of LP tokens staked.
Unless you continue to provide liquidity, your holdings and corresponding reward earnings will gradually be diluted.

# Attracting liquidity
Apart from the reduced fee's out initial distribution epoch with the majority of supply being distributed in a matter of days to attract the whales.
We deem whale attracting important as those are the ones that have the ability to bring visibility and liquidity to a project.
But we haven't forgotten the minnows, the ones who don't catch the head start, once Clearing House launches POTUS will have a 1% transaction fee which will go towards the continued POTUS-USDT & USDC-ETH pools

# Token supply and distribution:
1,250,000 tokens
300,000 tokens on bounce pool during 2 rounds:
1st round 100,000 POTUS for 100 ETH total 1 hour duration (Completed)
2nd round 2000,000 POTUS to be re-announced (Coming Soon)
The bounce raised ETH will be used for deploying the contracts, and further development.
300,000 POTUS pool‚Ää-‚ÄäPOTUS -ETH
300,000 Trump pool‚Ää-‚ÄäPOTUS-USDC
300,000 Biden pool‚Ää-‚ÄäPOTUS-USDT
100,000 Developer Pool

# üí∏ Reward Distribution
With the current UniSwap configuration, 0.3% of all trading fees in any pool are proportionately distributed to the pool's liquidity providers.
In ClearingHouse, we aim to help with the rising ETH fee's thus lowering the overall trading fee's to 0.15%, of which 0.125% go directly to the active liquidity providers,

while the remaining 0.025% get converted back to POTUS (obviously through ClearingHouse) and distributed to the POTUS token holders üìà.
This way we help both smaller traders in remedying for the ETH transaction fee's,
as well attract big traders with offering them a two times better rate on the fee's that hit them the most, the exchange fee's.
Ensuring Project Sustainability (aka. Developers Fund)
Rather then taking a fixed % (like 10% on each transaction in SUSHI example) the team has decided to make an initial bounce rise,
with the target of 500 ETH, which will be used for liquidity, development and deployments & to keep interest in project 100 000 POTUS are the teams reward.

# The Liquidity Migration‚Ñ¢Ô∏è
Around 60 days from now a.k.a Election Day from the protocol's inception, we will be migrating all the liquidity tokens staked onto the president finance contracts.
This migration will involve taking all of the Uniswap LP tokens staked on president.finance, redeeming them on Uniswap for the respective token pairs, and initializing new liquidity pools from those tokens.
These new pools will be almost identical to the standard Uniswap pool, with the added feature that any fees accrued will be distributed to POTUS token holders through the logic outlined above.
Thank you for your interest in President.Finance (POTUS). Please stay tuned for ICO details to come.
Kind Regards,
The President.Finance Team
